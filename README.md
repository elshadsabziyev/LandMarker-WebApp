## 🌟 Introduction

LandMarker is a Python-based application designed for landmark detection using the Google Cloud Vision API, Streamlit, 
Folium and OpenAI's API. The application allows users to upload images containing landmarks, and the system will show the location of the landmark on an interactive map. The application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with a simple and intuitive interface. AI integration help to maintain this intuitive interface and provide short summary about the landmark. The application is designed to be easily deployable and scalable, with the potential for future enhancements and integrations.

## ⭐ Features

LandMarker offers the following features:
- **Image Upload**: Easily upload images containing landmarks for recognition.
- **Landmark Detection**: Utilizes the Google Cloud Vision API for precise landmark recognition in images.
- **Geographical Mapping**: Retrieves geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of detected landmarks.
- **Interactive Map Display**: Exhibits detected landmarks on an interactive map using the Folium library.
- **AI Integration**: Provides a short summary about the landmark using OpenAI API.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Google Cloud Vision API**: Empowers the system for landmark detection in images.
- **Folium**: Python library employed for creating interactive maps.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework facilitating the user interface.
- **OpenAI API**: Used for providing short summary about the landmark.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Utilized for image processing and display.

## 🛠️ Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
        ```bash
        git clone
        ```
    - Enter the project directory:
        ```bash
        cd landmarker
        ```
2. **Set Up Environment**: Create a virtual environment and install required dependencies.
   - Create a virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        ```
    - Activate the virtual environment:
      - For Linux/Mac:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      - For Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Setup**: Establish a GCP project, enable the Vision API, and configure credentials.
    - Create a new project on GCP.
    - Enable the Vision API for the project.
    - Create a service account and download the JSON credentials file.
    - Go to https://www.convertsimple.com/convert-json-to-toml/ and convert the JSON file to TOML format.
    - Save the TOML file as secret.toml under the .streamlit directory.
4. **OpenAI API Setup**: Obtain an API key for OpenAI and store it in the secret.toml file.
    - Sign up for OpenAI and obtain an API key.
    - Add the API key to the secret.toml file with key openai_api_key. It should look like this:
        ```toml
        openai_api_key = "your_api_key_here"
        ```
5. **Running the Application**: Execute specific commands to run the Streamlit application.
    - Run the following command to start the application:
        ```bash
        streamlit run app.py
        ```
    - The application will start and provide a URL for accessing the interface.

## 🚀 Usage

For local usage, credentials should be stored in a secret.toml file. For deployment on Streamlit Sharing or other hosting platforms, ensure the application is appropriately configured for deployment and follow platform-specific instructions.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

- **For Streamlit Sharing**: Follow these steps to deploy the application on Streamlit Sharing:
    1. Create a GitHub repository with the project files or just fork this repository.
    2. Sign in to Streamlit Sharing and connect your GitHub repository.
    3. While configuring the deployment, ensure the required environment variables are set.
    4. Access the application using the provided URL.
    5. If you have any issues, consult the [Streamlit Sharing Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/deploy_streamlit_app.html).
- **For Other Platforms**: Consult the documentation for the specific hosting platform for deployment instructions.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Components
- **Google Cloud Vision API**: Handles landmark detection in images.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides short summary about the landmark.
- **GeoCoding API**: Used for getting the name of the City and Country of the landmark using reverse geocoding.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for creating the user interface.
- **Folium Map**: Used to display detected landmarks on an interactive map.
- **Python Backend**: Utilizes Streamlit to create the user interface and Folium for map generation.

### Workflow
1. User uploads an image via the Streamlit interface.
2. Python backend sends the image data to the Google Cloud Vision API for landmark detection.
3. The API returns landmark information (name and coordinates).
4. GeoCoding API is used to get the name of the City and Country of the landmark using reverse geocoding from the coordinates.
5. OpenAI API is used to get a short summary about the landmark using the name of the landmark.
6. Folium library creates an interactive map displaying the detected landmark.
